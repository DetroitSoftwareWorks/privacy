## Your data

The Detroit Software Works doesn't fucking *want* your data.

We don't want to have your email address, we don't want to have to track your password for our services, we don't want to store your location on our servers, and we really don't want your Social Security numbers.

So we don't do any of that stuff. We don't store any of your data on our servers, and if we do, we'll tell you here.

Your data that we store on our servers:
- (this list is empty)

Your data that we store on your device:
- Audio information that we've recorded when you pressed the record button in the app. That audio information gets deleted when you press the delete button in the app.

Your data that we store in your account in a cloud service:
- Right now, we don't store any data in the cloud. We are thinking about backing up your audio information to your cloud account. If we do that, we won't have any outside access to it, we'd only be able to get to that service because you allow it, and access controls for that data are strictly between you and your cloud service provider.

## Known Breaches

To date, since we don't store any of your data on our servers, we have had no instances of anyone stealing your data from our servers.

We have had zero avowable requests from law enforcement for access to our logs, etc.

We have never been served any National Security Letters or any other secret law enforcement or governmental order.
